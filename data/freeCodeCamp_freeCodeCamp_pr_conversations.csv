Yea, the labs should have a `demoType` of `onClick` I believe - that will show the button to open the preview. And step-1 of the workshops should have a `demoType` of `onLoad` I believe (assuming we want it) - which opens the preview on that step.

We could add another step and let the users create that?

The issue with that is there is no good way to test that they created variable and assigned it the result of called the `getRoundResults`. We would have to use regex tests here, which I don't think we should do here

```js
function getRoundResults(userOption) {
  const computerResult = getRandomComputerResult();
 
}
```

even if we try to update step 6 to have them create the function and mention that they should create a variable of their choice and assign that function call, the directions are already long enough as is. So my concern of adding another sentence of two will make it to long and crowded.

`forEach` always returns `undefined` and it is meant for side effects. It doesn't matter if the callback has an implicit or explicit return, the callback can't return anything.

In fact, we might want to avoid the expression body syntax with `forEach`. Seeing as the callback can't return anything, implying otherwise by using an implicit return could be seen as dishonest syntax. Don't get me wrong, I have certainly written `forEach` loops with an expression body before. I'm just not sure if we should be promoting it.

```
numbersArr.forEach((el) => {
  counts[el] = (counts[el] || 0) + 1;
});
```


Also, this is just my personal opinion, but the way it is worded makes it sound like they should prefer the much less readable version because the readable version is too verbose. Furthermore, simplification is not the same as shorter syntax, in this case, I would say the shorter version is not a simplification because it is harder to read.

All this just to say, I think we have to be careful about what we promote and how we do it."

As it stands it's very hard to parse the difference between NewQuestion, QuestionType, NewQuestionType, NewConfig, question_types inside new configs vs question_types in new exam and so on.

If we had a high-level terminology document, like we do for Workshop, Lecture, Lab and the like, then it shouldn't be too hard to disentangle these concepts."

That's the one!

> But the first test on those steps checks for the variable declaration - e.g. `const button2` which overwrites the global. So I didn't see why they needed to be changed.

It looks slightly like the best case scenario. The worst one is a bit nitpicking, but other test:
```js
assert.match(code, /const\s+button2/);
```
Would of course match `const button2something`. Only related test is changed, but it increases confidence for this one as well."

With very large fonts, there is an overflow on input-container at one point. I did move the MQ breakpoint, but I guess I didn't test it with very large fonts (or I added the monospace font after I had tested it).

In this case, I don't think MDN is giving you all of the options for managing focus in a modal dialog. You don't have to place the focus on an element in the dialog, you can place it on the dialog itself. Oh, actually, I just checked, and the [MDN page for the dialog element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog#accessibility) does actually suggest this.

You can open the modal manually in the local environment by setting `open={true}`:

But if you're on production, you can trigger the modal by completing three challenges.

--- 

There is also a guide that W3 provides: https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/. The doc says we can even place the focus on the text content, rather than a focusable element. But I wasn't sure if that's the case here, since the context is clear enough.

> If the dialog content includes semantic structures, such as lists, tables, or multiple paragraphs, that need to be perceived in order to easily understand the content, i.e., if the content would be difficult to understand when announced as a single unbroken string, then it is advisable to add `tabindex=""-1""` to a static element at the start of the content and initially focus that element. This makes it easier for assistive technology users to read the content by navigating the semantic structures. Additionally, it is advisable to omit applying `aria-describedby` to the dialog container in this scenario.

I made the following changes:
- When the second part of the modal shows up, focus on the benefit list (by setting `tabIndex={-1}`) instead of the donate button
  - Now that I'm visiting this behavior again, I think putting the focus on the donate button might be perceived as a dark pattern (you know, conveniently placing the focus on the button that starts a subscription) even though that's not our intention.
- Removed the styles of focus and active states from the donate button. On focus, the button will just have a focus outline.

I tested the Paypal and Stripe buttons on production, and found that their focus state are different:

<details>
  <summary>Image</summary>

| Paypal | Stripe |

It looks like the Paypal button should be updated to match the Stripe one, but I'm not sure if the differences are intentional or not. I'll need your help with the fix here if it's needed, I tried adding Paypal credentials to `.env` but I wasn't able to get the button show up on the screen."

Successful Reset Status Code Update: Previously, when a reset operation was successful, we were using a 204 No Content status code. While this accurately represented the idea that the operation doesn't need to return any content, it did pose some limitations on providing feedback to the client, particularly about what was done. So, I've updated this to use a 202 Accepted status code. This change allows us to include a response body with message and devMessage, improving the feedback loop to our clients about the reset operation's success, especially useful for logging and debugging purposes.

No Challenges to Reset Status Code Change: For scenarios where the reset request is valid, but there are no challenges to reset (because the user hasn't completed any in the requested blocks), previously used a 202 Accepted. To make our response more intuitive and to clearly indicate that the request was processed successfully but resulted in no operational changes, I've shifted this to a 200 OK status code. It's a subtle change that helps clarify the outcome was as expected, just without any action needed."

Hello everyone @ShaunSHamilton @Sembauke @ojeytonwilliams

**@moT01**, much appreciation for the thorough testing and detailed feedback, thank you!

Here are my thoughts on each of the points raised:

1. **Clarifying Superblock in Reset:**
   - I agree that including the superblock in the reset endpoint to avoid potential issues with duplicate block names in the future is a good idea.

2. **Endpoint Naming and Method:**
   - I don‚Äôt think changing the endpoint naming and method has something to do with this PR. The mission of this PR as I see it, is to reset a superblock and address the backend functionality of [Issue #47464](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/47464). I also have a somehow related frontend PR [#54028](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/54028).

3. **Resetting Certification Projects:**
   - I don‚Äôt have a strong opinion on this as it seems to be more of a product decision.

4. **Handling PartiallyCompletedChallenges and SavedChallenges:**
   - I see your point. I think we should address this issue here. I would love to get some guidance on this matter, or if anyone else wants to collaborate with me on this, it would be welcomed.

5. **Returning Updated Challenge Arrays:**
   - I think we have gone back and forth on what should be returned. I initially wanted to tackle it in the frontend [#54028](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/54028). I can dive into the code and see what‚Äôs best to return accordingly. If someone already has the answer, that‚Äôs okay too.

6. **Messaging for No Challenges Reset:**
   - I will try to reproduce the issue. Can you provide the exact input you used?

7. **Adding Tests:**
   - I would love to add the tests, though I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs related to this PR.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Best regards,  
Ravid

The issue with this is that the certification projects are required to claim a certification. Here's [one of mine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/mot01/responsive-web-design) - the projects I submitted to earn it are at the bottom. With the current implementation, if we reset a block with any of those cert projects, the project(s) submitted will be lost, but the certification will still be claimed. We like to keep the projects people submitted so we can validate them if needed. I listed two options in my review. I think we should see what some others say on this.

4. I think you should be able to just delete from those two arrays in the same way you did with `completedChallenges` - e.g:

```
$pull: {
  completedChallenges: { id: { $in: toResetChallengeIds } },
  savedChallenges: { id: { $in: toResetChallengeIds } },
  partiallyCompletedChallenges: { id: { $in: toResetChallengeIds } },
}
```

5. I'm not sure on this one either. I think we are probably fine with just returning the messages for now and letting the clients handle it. Maybe others can weigh in.

6. I saw this multiple times with multiple different blocks. This was one: `body: {""blocks"": [""learn-greetings-in-your-first-day-at-the-office""]}`

7. I think tests are important cause they verify that the endpoint is doing what's expected and also let others know what the endpoint is doing. There's some examples you can [follow in here.](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/tree/main/api-server/src/server/boot_tests) I would lean towards adding them, but perhaps we can defer until the new API."

I do agree with Tom, though: while names like `challengesWithCompleted` are rather ugly, they are more accurate than `progressionNodes`. The problem is ""Node"" doesn't really mean anything as far as the UI is concerned it only has meaning in the context of a graphQL query. I appreciate that we've mixed these up numerous times in the code base, but I'd rather we removed the other instances rather than added more.

As for Tile, it seems fine to use that for a UI component, but not for data. For example the type `ProgressionTilesWithCompleted` doesn't make sense to me, since it has no intrinsic connection to Tiles. It just happens that some data with that type is going to passed into them as a prop. In contrast, I like the tile components challenge-tile.tsx and challenge-tiles-list because it's clear what they are.

And, finally, maybe we want to put the Tiles in https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/ui, maybe we don't. However, I take back my previous comment. We can decide the best place for them later, there's no need to hold up this PR while we decide."
