https://api.github.com/repos/OptimalBits/bull/pulls/comments/347089808,317968482,347089808,lib/repeatable.js,I am not sure about this. Why do we need to delete it? ,manast,https://github.com/manast,2019-11-16T12:34:34Z,2021-03-20T12:18:34Z,https://api.github.com/repos/OptimalBits/bull/pulls/1422
https://api.github.com/repos/OptimalBits/bull/pulls/comments/347090028,317968730,347090028,lib/repeatable.js,Because it will be re-used by the next job and that's not what I want. When the first job have been completed `nextJobFromJobData` is called but we need to plan the next job to the next interval not immediately.,HugoPoi,https://github.com/HugoPoi,2019-11-16T12:41:31Z,2021-03-20T12:18:34Z,https://api.github.com/repos/OptimalBits/bull/pulls/1422

https://api.github.com/repos/OptimalBits/bull/pulls/comments/347130850,318014451,347130850,lib/repeatable.js,OK so my first solution was better ? If we don't want to mutate so we need to add a separate flag on the prototype of `nextRepeatableJob` and all over the code ?,HugoPoi,https://github.com/HugoPoi,2019-11-17T11:23:57Z,2021-03-20T12:18:34Z,https://api.github.com/repos/OptimalBits/bull/pulls/1422
