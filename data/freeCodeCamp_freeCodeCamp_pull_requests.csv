fix: correct question options for integer size in numpy-introduction-b,https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/56002,56002,open,Teddydesta,https://github.com/Teddydesta,2024-09-04T15:03:06Z,2024-09-04T17:05:15Z,,,,,[],"['status: blocked', 'scope: curriculum']",,b48caf5121439d19bcc55aa4c7807d4e10f61149,fix/numpy-intro-b-question,main,"### Description

This pull request addresses issue #55999, which reports an incorrect option in the ""Data Analysis with Python - NumPy Introduction B"" lesson. The issue specifically relates to the question about the memory consumption of an integer in plain Python.

#### Problem

The current question options provide the following choices:

- 32 bits
- 20 bytes
- 16 bytes
- 8 bits

However, according to the issue reporter and further verification, the correct size of an integer `5` in plain Python is 28 bytes, which is not included in the available options.

Here's a screenshot showing the original incorrect options:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14e40ab0-4e08-4019-b0f8-85e568e30453)
#### Solution

To fix this issue, I have updated the `numpy-introduction-b.md` file in the following way:

- Replaced the incorrect option ""32 bits"" with the correct option ""28 bytes"".
- Updated the `## --video-solution--` section to reflect the index of the correct option (1, since ""28 bytes"" is now the first option).

By making these changes, the question now accurately reflects the memory consumption of an integer in plain Python, providing learners with the correct information and ensuring the integrity of the lesson content.

After making the changes, the options now appear correctly:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01fce3ac-d5f0-4bbf-8490-84fce68481c2)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2458c66a-626c-4848-b0e1-59a54d84a106)

#### Testing

I have tested the changes locally by following these steps:

1. Opened the freeCodeCamp application or the local development server.
2. Navigated to the ""Data Analysis with Python - NumPy Introduction B"" lesson.
3. Verified that the question options now include the correct option ""28 bytes"" and that the video solution index is updated accordingly.

Everything appears to be working as expected, and the lesson content is now accurate.

#### Additional Notes

While working on this issue, I also noticed that the issue description mentioned the size of the integer `5` as 28 bytes, which includes 24 bytes for the integer object itself and 4 bytes for the reference count. However, since the question specifically asks about the memory consumption of the integer `5` in plain Python, I have updated the options to reflect the total size of 28 bytes, as per the issue reporter's observation.

If there are any concerns or additional feedback, please let me know. I'm happy to make further adjustments or provide more information as needed.

The issue was caused by React batching renders for some events, but not others. Since it's not something we can (easily?) control, I tried to make sure that the lower jaw works regardless. i.e. if `attempts` changes on a separate render to `hint`, that's fine, and it should work if they change on the same render.

This _should_ keep the screen reader behaviour we want, but I'm not 100% sure what the desired behaviour actually is. It's quite possible I broke something, though I did check that Orca still reads the hints when you run the tests (and only once!)

The last commit changes the UX a bit, so I'm happy to either not do that or create a separate PR for it. @ahmaxed could you weigh in on the UX?

This is a very basic demo to continue the conversation.  For instances, I think it could be improved by moving at least the collapsible descriptions to below the video, if not all descriptions. Also, the copy could use some work - ""More information"" is okay, but probably not ideal.

Once everyone's happy with the design, I'll apply it to the other challenge type(s). Presumably multiple choice, but I wasn't sure if it should be on dialogues, too.

This extracts the assignments, mc questions, and fill in the blanks into their own components - so we can reuse them in multiple places.

This will make it easier to add the many mc questions per challenge that I am trying to add.

There shouldn't be much for visible changes. A few minor things - mainly, it moves the ""Please complete the assignments"" to right below the assignments.

Also, if I get around to it - the end goal might be to have a single view component that incorporates all these features.

It's a start to allowing many multiple choice questions on a single challenge. It adjusts the challenge parser to allow more questions by just adding additional `--text--`, `--answers--`, and `--video-solution--` headers - and puts all the questions in an array.

For now, the client just gets the first in the array and uses the rest of the existing code. I will make another PR to map over them and display them all.

To test: you can find any multiple choice challenge, add an additional questions by copy/pasting the question that's there - just the `text`, `answers` and `video-solution` part. To end up with something like this:

Then find the challenge in graphiql and check the questions.

One extra change I made was to move all the `--assignment--` headers that were nested in a question to outside of the question. Those were all in the Odin section.

There's a lot to do before this is robust, but with this small change you can render inline JSX. This does mean that every challenge that uses `type=""text/babel""` will compile JSX, but I plan to fix that soon. Also, there aren't any challenges that use it at the moment.

For future reference, I tried to do this without making use of our transformation pipeline, but I couldn't see a nice way to handle imports. Typically what you do is import the module

```html
<script
   data-plugins=""transform-modules-umd""
   type=""text/babel""
   src=""thing-you-want.js"">
</script>
```

and then use that module

```html
 <script
   data-plugins=""transform-modules-umd""
   data-type=""module""
   type=""text/babel""
>
   import { thing } from './thing-you-want.js';
 </script>
 ```

but `thing-you-want.js` doesn't exist and so the first script doesn't attach the ""module"" to the global scope in a way that the importing script can use (via its ""moduleId"").  You can create custom presets for `transform-modules-umd`, to force the  moduleId, but you need one per file you'd like to import and it gets messy quickly.

I could be missing something obvious, but for now it seems easier to rely on the transformation pipeline.

Closes #55821 

# Summary of Updates

## Enhancements to Collision Detection and Width Calculations

These updates enhance the flexibility of collision detection rules and width calculations, allowing for a wider range of expression formats.

## Key Changes

### Step 84: Half Width Calculation
- **Previous Limitation:**
  - Only recognized straightforward expressions like:
    ```javascript
    player.position.x >= platform.position.x - player.width / 2
    ```
- **New Capabilities:**
  - Supports various formats, including:
    ```javascript
    player.position.x >= platform.position.x - (player.width / 2)
    player.position.x >= platform.position.x - player.width * 0.5
    player.position.x >= platform.position.x - (0.5 * player.width)
    ```

### Step 85: One-Third Width Calculation
- **Previous Limitation:**
  - Recognized only:
    ```javascript
    player.position.x <= platform.position.x + platform.width - player.width / 3
    ```
- **New Capabilities:**
  - Handles multiple expressions, such as:
    ```javascript
    player.position.x <= platform.position.x + platform.width - (player.width / 3)
    player.position.x <= platform.position.x + platform.width - player.width * 1/3
    player.position.x <= platform.position.x + platform.width - (1/3 * player.width)
    ```

### Step 88: Additional Variants for One-Third Width
- **Previous Limitation:**
  - Limited to specific formats for one-third width calculations.
- **New Capabilities:**
  - Accommodates various representations including:
    ```javascript
    player.position.x <= platform.position.x + platform.width - player.width / 3
    player.position.x <= platform.position.x + platform.width - (player.width / 3)
    player.position.x <= platform.position.x + platform.width - player.width * 1/3
    player.position.x <= platform.position.x + platform.width - (1/3 * player.width)
    ```

### Step 89: Final Calculation Adjustment
- **Previous Limitation:**
  - Expression for comparing player’s `x` position and platform's dimensions did not account for all valid formats.
- **New Capabilities:**
  - Now accommodates various valid expressions, including:
    ```javascript
    player.position.x <= platform.position.x + platform.width - player.width / 3
    player.position.x <= platform.position.x + platform.width - (player.width / 3)
    player.position.x <= platform.position.x + platform.width - player.width * 1/3
    player.position.x <= platform.position.x + platform.width - (1/3 * player.width)
    ```

## Examples of Code That Works Now

- **Half Width Calculation:**
  - **Before:**
    ```javascript
    player.position.x >= platform.position.x - player.width / 2
    ```
  - **Now:**
    ```javascript
    player.position.x >= platform.position.x - (player.width / 2)
    player.position.x >= platform.position.x - player.width * 0.5
    player.position.x >= platform.position.x - (0.5 * player.width)
    ```

- **One-Third Width Calculation:**
  - **Before:**
    ```javascript
    player.position.x <= platform.position.x + platform.width - player.width / 3
    ```
  - **Now:**
    ```javascript
    player.position.x <= platform.position.x + platform.width - (player.width / 3)
    player.position.x <= platform.position.x + platform.width - player.width * 1/3
    player.position.x <= platform.position.x + platform.width - (1/3 * player.width)
    ```

These updates ensure that the code now accommodates a broader range of calculations and formats, making it more flexible and versatile.

In this block, I’m experimenting with new ways to create more engaging tasks, including speaking and reading activities.

Speaking practices start from Dialogue 2 because I hadn't planned them when creating Dialogue 1. Since we don’t have speaking challenges, I designed tasks where learners choose between two options that characters might use. In the future, learners can practice speaking by repeating the selected answer, allowing them to check both understanding and speaking skills. 

Even if we can't implement speaking practice, these tasks will still be useful, as they work in either scenario.

Reading tasks are placed after the dialogue questions. For Dialogue 1, I created a summary, and for Dialogue 2 and 3, an email from one of the characters.

The reading blocks are currently enclosed in backticks, which doesn’t look appealing. It would be great if we could improve how they look, similar to the solution Oliver used for the fill-in-the-blanks.

I’m not sure if we’ll adopt all the solutions I’m proposing, but I’ve created these tasks to start the discussion. Please feel free to try them out and share your thoughts.

Closes #55714 

<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->

This PR enhances the test cases to ensure that campers completely remove the myTaskArr array and all related localStorage items in their code. Previously, the tests would pass even if only one or two tasks were deleted. With these changes, the tests will require the camper to fully remove all instances of myTaskArr and any associated localStorage items to proceed.

Changes Made:

1. **Regex Pattern Update**: Modified the regex pattern in the assert.notMatch function to comprehensively check the absence of any references to myTaskArr and related localStorage items.
2. **Additional Assertions: Added assertions to ensure**:
   - No declaration or use of myTaskArr exists in the code.
   - No retrieval of localStorage item ""data"".
   -  No setting of localStorage item ""data"" with myTaskArr.

Notes
- Step 1 - browser appears to fix many of the incorrectly defined `html`, `head`, `body`, including the lack of them.
- Step 18 & 29, wanna see _funny_ trick?
  1. Go to any page (not fCC limited, youtube could be used as well), for example https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/learn-basic-javascript-by-building-a-role-playing-game/step-18
  2. Open browser's console.
  3. Type either in browser's console, or in the editor: `console.log(button2)`
  4. See appear the `#button2` element in console.
  5. Try it with other ids with names that could be proper JS variables.
  6. Also see their elements printed in console.
  7. You can be as confused as I am.
- Steps with `pick` function and `if` statements. `pick.toString()` will added infinite loop protection to the loops. This uses `if`, which makes using `pick.toString()` to match `if` less convenient.",https://api.github.com/repos/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pulls/55580/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pulls/55580/commits,https://api.github.com/repos/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/statuses/af6c347126f0c8d0e04634c5a2f811f4ed38244b,MEMBER

Closes #55542

Don't consider this a massive improvement, I do think it looks better. Tested with different browser zoom and font size.

It's a lot of changes for such a simple bug, but I think it is worth the update. Even if we could fix it with fewer changes, e.g. switch to rem for the margin and lower the values.

Separate commits to keep track of what I was doing.

Ran the `sync-i18n` script, but it messed with a bunch of unrelated files. For example, it deleted Odin project files from the Chinese and Arabic files, and made other changes to unrelated files including creating files (1507 changes in total). So I reverted it back. Not sure what the correct process is or if the docs for updating step based challenges is out of date.

Other PRs for this challenge are in progress, so it will end up with merge conflicts that need to be fixed.

Changes made:

1. Use flexbox for the call stack layout.

2. Created a box for the call stack and gave it a heading.

3. Added monospace font style, personal preference, but I think it fits the subject.

4. Removed the inline margin on call stack `p` elements and the related challenge step.

There are a possibility syntax errors campers might not readily solve intefering with the tests. Rather than getting a message like ""You should declare a `xpText` variable with `const`."" , the challenge stops working on the first text involving a variable (The text one). 
 
Another possibility to solve this issue is moving the xpText and healthText and goldText upwards , but I like my tests grouped and in order.

This PR updates the donation modal to:
- Allow closing the modal by pressing Escape when the animation is complete
- Automatically focus on the donate button when the second part appears
  - There are two buttons on the modal: ""Become a Supporter"" and ""Ask me later"". The a11y recommendation is to have keyboard focus placed on a default focusable element in the modal. Generally the initial focus is set on the first focusable element, but we're free to decide what should receive the focus. I chose the ""Become a Supporter"" button because it's the first focusable element, but I'm open to suggestions here.

This PR introduces a new endpoint to freeCodeCamp's API: `/account/reset-progress/:dashedBlockName`, allowing Campers to selectively reset their progress on specific blocks within the curriculum. 

This addition addresses the community's request for more control over their learning journey, specifically targeting the need outlined in issue [#47464](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/47464).

**Key Components Added and Modified:**

- **`postResetProjectProgress` Function in `user.js`**: Handles the logic to filter and update a user's completed challenges, resetting progress for a specified block. This function serves as the backbone of the new endpoint, ensuring users can easily revert their progress on challenging sections.

- **Utilities in `get-blocks-challenges-mappings.js`**:
  - **`getChallengeMapByBlock`**: Generates a mapping of all curriculum blocks to their respective challenge IDs, facilitating quick lookups.
  - **`getChallengeIdsForBlock`**: Leverages the block-challenge map to fetch specific challenge IDs for a given block, throwing an error if no matching block is found. This utility is pivotal in validating the `dashedBlockName` parameter and retrieving the relevant challenge IDs to reset.

**Questions and Feedback:**

- **Response Design Considerations**: The current implementation returns a detailed response including the message and count of challenges reset. This approach diverges from our API's general pattern of returning minimalistic responses. I would like to gather feedback on whether we should adjust this endpoint to align with the existing response design of our API. Specifically, should we simplify our response to an empty JSON object for consistency, or is there merit in providing detailed responses for certain endpoints to enhance user experience?

This PR refactors the `Challenges` Component to improve adherence to SOLID principles and prepare for future feature additions such as solving issue [#47464](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/47464). 

The refactoring led to the creation of several new components:

- **`ChallengeBlock`**: Serves as the main container for individual challenges, encapsulating the logic and presentation of a single challenge.
- **`ProjectController`**: Nested within `ChallengeBlock`, this component is the command center for critical project actions. It holds the essential buttons that initiate core functions such as 'start' and 'reset' for the projects.
  - **`ProjectControlButton`**: A new component within `ProjectController` that provides interactive buttons for user actions like starting or (future) resetting a project.
- **`ChallengeOrProjectNodesList`**: A dynamic list that renders either challenge steps or project nodes depending on the context, ensuring modularity.
- **`ChallengeNodesList`**: Specifically handles the rendering of nodes for challenges, laying out each step in a structured manner.
  - **`ChallengeNodeTile`**: Represents an individual node or step in a challenge, providing a concise summary and interactive elements for users.
  - **`ProjectNodeTile`**: Similar to `ChallengeNodeTile`, but tailored for project steps, with additional controls suited for project-specific actions.

The decomposition into smaller components not only clarifies the structure and responsibilities within the codebase but also sets the stage for the easy addition of a reset button, directly addressing the needs of issue [#47464](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/47464).
